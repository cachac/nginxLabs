# Performance <!-- omit in toc -->


# 1. Worker process
- default 1
- common practice 1 worker / cpu
- 1 worker / 1 cpu = 100% worker/cpu (good)
- 2 worker / 1 cpu = 50% + 50% worker/cpu (bad)
- 1 worker / 2 cpu = 1 cpu idle (bad)
- auto: Nginx auto configure worker process

# 2. Worker connections
- connection by workers
- ej. worker_connection 1000 = 1000 request/second/worker_process
- default 768
- usually a browser opens 2-6 connections = 128 to 384 connections available
- check core limits: ulimit -n

## 2.1. check master & worker process
```
ps -aux --forest | grep nginx
```
> 1 master - 1 worker


## 2.2. config worker processes
```
worker_processes 3;
```
- check number processes: ps aux

## 2.3. check cpu count
```
lscpu

nproc
```


## 2.4. fix worker processes
```
worker_processes auto;
```
- reload and check workers: ps aux

## 2.5. how many IO operation can system handled
```
ulimit -n
```
## 2.6. set worker connections
```sh
events {
  worker_connections 1024;
}
```
- reload

## add default basic settings
```sh
http {
  ##
  # Basic Settings
  ##
  sendfile on;
  tcp_nopush on;
  types_hash_max_size 2048;
  include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
  default_type application/octet-stream;

  ##
  # SSL Settings
  ##
  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; # Dropping SSLv3, ref: POODLE
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
  include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
```
- reload & test web-profile
